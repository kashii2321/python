# in python there are 2 types of functions :
# built in functions and user defined functions
# BUILT IN FUNCTIONS - print , 

print("apnacollege","python")   # isme , is a separator jo by default ek gap de dega dono ke bichem
# chahe humne diya ho ya nhi 
print("apnacollege")   # now if i want to get these printed separately in different lines
print("python")        # to automatically it will assume end = \n jo apne aap dono lines ko alg
# alg lines mein print krke dega hume
# but ab agr mujhe dono ko saathme print krna h ek hi line mein to we can write
print("apnacollege" , end = " ")
print("python")
