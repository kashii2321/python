# All these are the ways in which we can write a string

# A string once written cannot be changed, you need to make a new one if any change is to be made

# In coding, we start the counting from 0, and if counting backwards we start from -1

# A string is immutable

#String Slicing
Name = "Kashvi"
# Now it has 5 characters (counting starts from 0)

Nameshort = Name[0:3]
# Start the index from 0 till 3, (excluding 3)

print(Nameshort)

character1 = Name[2]
print(character1)

# Now this will give the character of the name on that place

print(Name[:5])   #it means it wull start from 0, same as [0:5]
print(Name[1:])   #it means the length puri, same as [1:5]
