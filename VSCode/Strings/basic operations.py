# string is a data type that stores a sequence of characters
str1 = "This is a str.\nI am using Python"
print(str1)

# now if i wrote "this is a string. i am using python"
# and i want that the second line 'i am using python' wali next line mein aaye for that we use \n

# similary to give a tab space between two lines we write \t
# these are known as escape sequence characters

# CONCATENATION - 2 STRINGS KO ADD KRNA, for it we use +
a = "apna"
b = "college"
print(a+b)  # output will be apnacollege 

# to find length of any string we use len(str)
print(len(b))  # it will also count the no of empty spaces in it
